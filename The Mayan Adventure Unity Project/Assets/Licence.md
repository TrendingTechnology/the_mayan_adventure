Some assets of the Mayan Adventure where taken from assets packs:
- [3D Game Kit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/3d-game-kit-115747): A fantastic environment created by Unity, I use their rock platforms, buttons, pillars.
- [Unity Particle Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-particle-pack-127325): I used it for the fire system.
- [Creator kit: puzzle](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/creator-kit-puzzle-149311): For the win particle fireworks.
- [Skybox series free](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/skybox-series-free-103633)

- The other elements, wood bridge, and animation, rock heads, golden statue, fedora, etc were made with Blender.
