The Mayan Adventure is an open-source reinforcement learning environment for Unity ML-Agents.  In this environment, you train your agent (Indie) to find the golden statue in this dangerous environment full of traps.

You can see the trained agent result here: [Link to the video](https://youtu.be/kKng-vRy6bs)
